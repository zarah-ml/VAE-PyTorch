# Variational Autoencoder implementation in Pytorch

This repo provides implementation of a convolutional VAE on Fashion-MNIST dataset. The aim of this notebook is to provide a quick, working example of the VAE Generative model. The notebook can be run in Google colab as is!

## Results

Following is the video of images reconstructed during validation.
